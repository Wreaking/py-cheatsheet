# py-cheatsheet
the full explanation of python

# Introduction 
Hello there, im Abdul Qaadir Mohiuddin Riaz aka Wreaking own this repo and this repo can only accessed by my fellow hackathon team., This repo is based upon the complete course of python. 
- I made these notes, because I usually forget some stuff about Python. So I used to refer from these notes.
- I thought of sharing these notes with everyone, because everyone deservers to learn Python.
- I tried my best to make it easy for you guys, so that you understand the basic concept.
- You need to practice it on a daily basis, if you are willing to learn Python.

So let's begin!
```
print("Hello World")
```
